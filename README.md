# Usurper
[Hesburgh Library](https://library.nd.edu) website frontend written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org). It relies primarly on [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) as a headless CMS for content as well as multiple custom microservices.

### Building the urls from the exports
Before running, you will need to build the config file. All URLs and parameters needed are stored in AWS; run the following to fetch them locally.

  * `cd scripts`
  * `yarn install`
  * assume a role that can access the exports (or use `aws-vault`)
  * `node buildConfig.js stage=dev`

### Running Locally
* `yarn start`
* Open browser to http://localhost:3000

### Running Tests

* `yarn test`

## Branching Strategy
We have two main branches, `master` and `prep`. `master` is "production ready" and is what ends up getting tagged and deployed to production. `prep` is what all branches get merged into for testing and User Aceptance (UA). All development branches should start off of master, be iterated on, and merged into `prep` (with a pull request). After the changes are accepted, that branch may then be merged into `master` and deleted. Remember, the **feature branch** is merged into `master`, **not `prep` directly**. This also means **`prep` should not be merged into your development branch at any time**. We don't want to accidentally get unapproved changes into master.

## Deployment to AWS
A continuous integration pipeline handles all build and deployment to test environments. There is a pipeline for the `prep` branch which is triggered on each push; these changes get deployed to https://prep.library.nd.edu/. The production pipeline is based on `master`. In order to allow for batches of changes to be easily grouped and released together, checkout `master` and run `./release.sh` from the root. This should do everything necessary to prepare a release candidate and kick off the pipeline.
